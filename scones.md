#How to make scones — a step-by-step guide

It’s so easy to rustle up a scone-based recipe and the technique is the same whether you’re making sweet or savoury scones. Once you’ve mastered how to make scones, try the tasty scone recipes below.

This scone recipe makes around 8 to 10 scones using a 6-cm cutter.

## Ingredients

* 250g self-raising flour
* 1/2 tsp baking powder
* pinch of salt
* 50g chilled butter, cubed
* 30g castor sugar
* 150ml buttermilk

##How to make scones

1. Heat the oven to 220°C. Sift the self-raising flour, baking powder and salt into a large bowl. Rub the butter into the flour until it resembles fine breadcrumbs.

2. Stir  in the castor sugar. Make a well in the centre of the dry ingredients and add the buttermilk. Mix with a knife until the mixture comes together to form a soft dough.


3. Lightly knead the mix together until the dough is smooth (but be careful not to overknead). Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work top. Roll out the dough to 2cm thick. Dip your cutter in a little flour, then put it on the dough.

4. Using the palm of your hand, press down smoothly and quickly — don’t be tempted to twist or wriggle the cutter because the dough sticks together and doesn’t rise neatly when cooking. This is our number one tip to remember when learning how to make scones.
